# This Makefile provides basic variables and rules for Objective
# Caml projects. It is shared among different projects via
# CVS. Therefore it should be rather generic - add project specific
# changes to the project's Makefile. Specific variables can be
# overridden in the project Makefile (and should).
#
# Normally the project Makefile includes this Makefile near its
# top.
